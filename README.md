## Getting Started

Apollo 5.5 is loaded with new modules and features but needs to be calibrated and configured perfectly before you take it for a spin. Please review the prerequisites and installation steps in detail to ensure that you are well equipped to build and launch Apollo. You could also check out Apollo's architecture overview for a greater understanding of Apollo's core technology and platform.

**[Attention]** The Apollo team is proud to announce that the platform has been migrated to Ubuntu 18.04, one of the most requested upgrades from our developers. We do not expect a disruption to your current work with the Apollo platform, but for perception related code, you would need to:

1. Upgrade host to ubuntu_16.04 and above (Ubuntu 18.04 is preferred)
2. Update local host NVIDIA driver >=410.48. [Website link](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us). Or follow the [guide](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo-kernel/tree/master/linux/Install_nvidia_driver_on_ubuntu_18.04.md) to install Apollo-Kernel and NVIDIA driver, if you want to install Apollo-Kernel.
3. Install latest Docker-CE (19.03+) by following the [official doc](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu).
4. Install latest nvidia-container-toolkit by following the [official doc](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).

For those developers that would like to continue working with Ubuntu 14.04, please use the [Ubuntu 14.04 branch](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/tree/ubuntu_14.04) instead of the master branch.

**[Attention]** The Apollo team has decided to retire Git LFS, which might impact your development. For details, please refer to:
[migration guide](docs/howto/how_to_migrate_to_the_updated_apollo_master_from_old_versions.md).

[Want to contribute to our code?](CONTRIBUTING.md) Follow this guide.

## Prerequisites

#### Basic Requirements:

* The vehicle equipped with the by-wire system, including but not limited to brake-by-wire, steering-by-wire, throttle-by-wire and shift-by-wire (Apollo is currently tested on Lincoln MKZ)

* A machine with a 4-core processor and 8GB memory minimum (16GB for Apollo 3.5 and above)

* Ubuntu 18.04

* Working knowledge of Docker


 - Please note, it is recommended that you install the versions of Apollo in the following order:
 **1.0 > whichever version you would like to test out**.
 The reason behind this recommendation is that you need to confirm whether individual hardware components
 and modules are functioning correctly and clear various version test cases,
 before progressing to a higher, more capable version for your safety and the safety of those around you.

#### Individual Version Requirements:

The following diagram highlights the scope and features of each Apollo release:
